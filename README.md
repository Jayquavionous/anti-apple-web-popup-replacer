# anti-apple-web-popup-replacer
a userscript (compatible with the [Userscripts](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts) Safari extension, and [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net)) designed to replace [eepyfemboi's "anti-apple-web-popup".](https://github.com/eepyfemboi/anti-apple-web-popup) with a different message, using the exact same pop-up design as the original one.

the message is basically telling user that its fine use whatever they like and don't be judgmental about what devices other are using.

main limitation of this script is that it only checks for the exact js file that is linked on eepyfemboi's github page, so if the website implemented the script in a different way than what was instructed in the original script, this script will not work.

i know im two months late to this whole thing but idk i got bored and randomly remembered about this extension so i got this idea.

also btw this is just all jokes and games, dont take ts seriously 💀🙏. no hate to eepyfemboi btw
