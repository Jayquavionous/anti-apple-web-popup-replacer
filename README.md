# anti-apple-web-popup-remover
a userscript (compatible with the [Userscripts](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts) Safari extension, and hypothetically [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) too) designed to remove eepyfemboi's "anti-apple-web-popup" [eepyfemboi's "anti-apple-web-popup".](https://github.com/eepyfemboi/anti-apple-web-popup)

this might even be possible to run in Shortcuts too, just can't be bothered testing atm

**I do not know who you think you are to lecture me on what device I choose to utilize to access your website. The web is an open platform. If this was discriminating against Windows, Linux, or Android users, everyone would care.**

**Many of the points in your argument are invalid.** And your popup's design just sucks (horrendous design in light mode, isn't adaptive to mobile) and never can go away permanently. No one's gonna be convinced to switch from Apple platforms because of your stupid site. This is for the sake of making a statement more than it is about genuine functionality, since only 1-3 people are ever gonna use this popup.

So, finally, checkmate, and farewell.

(By the way, we can also just change user agents or disable JS to stop this, lmfao.)
