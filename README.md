# anti-apple-web-popup-replacer
a userscript (compatible with the [Userscripts](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts) Safari extension, and [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net)) designed to replace [eepyfemboi's "anti-apple-web-popup".](https://github.com/eepyfemboi/anti-apple-web-popup) with a different message, using the exact same pop-up design as the original one.

the message is basically telling user that its fine use whatever they like and don't be judgemental about what devices other are using.

i know im two months late to this whole thing but idk i got bored and randomly remembered about this extension so i got this idea.
